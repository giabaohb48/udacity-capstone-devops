# Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Program
# Capstone Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I applied the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working with AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building Jenkins pipelines
* Building Docker containers in the pipelines
* Working with `eksctl` and `kubectl` to build and deploy Kubernetes clusters

As a capstone project, the directions are rather more open-ended than they were in the previous projects in the program. I developed a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with rolling deployment.
